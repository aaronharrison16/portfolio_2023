        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Aaron Harrison, a full-stack developer based in Lehi, Utah. I am passionate about delivering high-quality, pixel-perfect, user experiences.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You can generally find me working on the front end. I have strong experience in Vue.js, Next.js, React Native, and even niches like Blazor.
          While the front end is my happy place, I can hold my own through the full stack. I have worked in Rails, Python, and most recently dotnet.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When I am not writing code, you can catch me with my family, in the mountains, on the golf course, or on the river (failing at) fly fishing.
